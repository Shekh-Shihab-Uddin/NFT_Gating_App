I have created my own #nft #gating and #minting Application. In this decentralized application, you need have at least one NFT in your wallet or account to reveal the secret message in it. If you don't have it there is also facility that the owner of the NFT can mint NFT to your account and then you can have the access. After accessing with the help of web hooks your account is monitored. If you transfer your nft/s to others and you have zero nft token, then you automatically loose the access of that secret page any get out of it.

For Minting:
— Created the #solidity smart contract following the #ERC721 standard with the help of #OpenZeppelin
— Used #hardhat framework to deploy the contract on #sepolia test-net and checked the transaction in the #seppolia.ethescan.io
— implemented #expressjs , #nodejs in the backend
— used #reactjs to create the frontend 
— Also used #ipfs to keep the image of the nft token

Specially For gating:
— implemented #webhooks with the help of #quicknode and #ngrok

Steps:
1. run the server.js(comand: node server)
2. run ngrok cli and get the link created by the ngrok(comand: ngrok http <server_port_no>)
3. paste the link in the destination.js (node destination)
4. then get the generated destinationID from the console and paste it in the notification.js
5. run the notification.js(comand: node notification)
6. it will create the api for calling the webhook in the quickode
7. then run the client app. (comand: cd client -> npm run dev)
8. then visualize the operations here for example example: nft gating or nft minting
